<h2> The Hidden Gem <h2>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-align:center;"> <font size="4">Singapore has it's very own cat island located to the south of the main island of Singapore. Despite it's quaint appearance, Saint John's Island's dark history hides behind the sandy beaches and coastal reefs. In the 19th century, it was previously a centre for quarantine for immigrants that contracted cholera and victims of beri-beri and leprosy. It also housed political prisoners and a rehabilatation centre for drug abusers. 
However today, it is a popular offshore island destination for adventure-goers.   </font></p>
